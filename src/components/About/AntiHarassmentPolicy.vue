                    Exhibiting partners and guests are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors and speakers should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material, or otherwise create a sexualized environment in their slide decks, exhibit material, exhibit staffing, promotional items or demo material. 
                    <br><br>
                    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer or event volunteer immediately. Organizers and event volunteers may be identified by t-shirts or special badges/lanyards. Organizers will investigate the issue and take appropriate action. This may include helping participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist these experiencing harassment to fell safe for the duration of the event. 
                    <br><br>
                    Though we hope that we never have to invoke this policy, we believe that having this document helps everyone think a little more about how their actions and words affect the whole community, as well as individuals in the community.
